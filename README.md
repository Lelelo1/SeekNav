Debscription av usage:
Make a text search. Raise the phone. If there are hits on your search they will be shown in the camera. Tap a white bubble to select it as a desination. Access an arrow by tilting down. Cancel the navigation and exit the arrow by tapping the "X" top right.
The direction of bubble and arrow are "as the crows fly". The accuracy should be expected to be around 30 meters. Some local tempory magnetic disturbance can cause innaccuracy, in this case i'ts best to just try and keep walking out of it.
